This application is a game library, where user can buy games.
At first commit exist 4 packeges (for controllers, for services, for repositories, and for models).
I realized the connection with database.
Services pack contains the logic for operation on database.
Model pack contains the model for database.
Repositories pack contains the interface for accesing the database.
Controllers pack contains the controller which map the operation executed on db.
